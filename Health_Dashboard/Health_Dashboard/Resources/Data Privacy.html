Your privacy is important and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering information from users of the App and with respect to the uses we make of that information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1">Information and Uses</a></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">When someone uses this App, our servers automatically gather information that allows the servers to communicate with the users mobile device during use. We also track such information as the number of times the app is used, number of unique users, session length of each use (to track average session time across all users), which parts &amp; functions of the app is being used, device ID, IP address (the Internet address assigned to your computer from your Internet Service Provider), domain type, user LanID, &amp; date and time of use. We use such information only for statistical purposes that help us design and administer the App.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information, that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. If during your use of the app you provide such information to log in (some apps require this to identify user), complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information. We may collect and use that Personal Information to provide you with products or services, confirm your identity, to bill you for products and services you request, to tell you about ExxonMobil products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. For employees</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">and contractors, personal Information may also be used to manage and provide training and to obtain course assessments and self-assessments concerning skills and competencies from participants in order to identify and enhance training activities.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">If this App requires you to login, a 3<span class="s1">rd </span>party data processor will also be used to identify you and confirm that you are authorized to utilize the App. The following additional information can be collected: Login ID, Email, Street, State, Postal Code, City, Country, Department, Phone, Mobile, Fax, Job Title, Preferred Language, Usage Location. The location data above will not contain your exact personal location or track your location unless expressly requested by the App. If location tracking is used in the App, after you initially authorize the tracking of your location you have the ability to uninstall the app or go to your settings to disable location tracking.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">This capability will only be used when it is important for the functionality in the App to work effectively. The data collected &amp; stored will be in the US, and like the data on all apps (mentioned above), it will be used only for analytical purposes (# of logins, # of users), &amp; to determine licensing &amp; payment for the 3<span class="s1">rd </span>party service. It could also be used for investigative purposes in response to a security event.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">As explained below in the section on Dissemination of Information to Third Parties, we do not distribute or sell Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your Personal Information from our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us, if that is your wish. If you notify us that Personal Information previously submitted to our site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections. To facilitate our efforts to meet your request, it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in which you provided Personal Information, e.g in connection with promotion of a specific product or service.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">Information Placed on Your Device</a></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">We may store some information (commonly known as a &quot;cookie&quot; or a “token”) on your device when you look at or use the App. This information facilitates customizing your use of the App and helps to avoid the need for you to re-enter your details (such as login credentials) every time you use it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">We may use third-party advertising technology to provide ads when you use Apps upon which we advertise.

We cannot be responsible for their privacy policies and practices and we make no representations or warranties about the privacy practices of those sites. Similarly, we cannot be responsible for the policies and practices of any site or App from which you linked to our App. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of other sites and contact the operator if you have concerns or questions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">Dissemination of Information to Third Parties</a></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Communicating via the Internet and sending information, products, and services to you by other means necessarily involves your Personal Information passing through or being handled by third-parties, but ExxonMobil does not sell or distribute your</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Personal Information to third parties for purposes of allowing them to market their products and services to you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

They have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">Personal data collected by ExxonMobil may be transferred among its various divisions and affiliated companies, around the world.
